# Nordic Unicorn News ü´é

**Tracking tomorrow's unicorns across the frozen north**

A real-time intelligence platform covering Nordic tech IPOs, listings, and innovation - with a focus on Defence, AI, and Mining sectors.

---

## Project Vision

Nordic Unicorn News is a two-layered system:

**Public Layer:** A free, accessible news site providing English-language coverage of Nordic IPOs, First North listings, and tech innovation. Think Bloomberg meets Scandinavian minimalism, with a moose mascot.

**Private Intelligence Layer:** A proprietary trading intelligence system that aggregates, analyzes, and feeds market data to autonomous trading agents. This layer remains invisible to the public.

---

## Core Sectors

We focus on three high-growth, underreported Nordic sectors:

- **Defence** - Nordic defence tech, NATO expansion beneficiaries, surveillance systems
- **AI** - Applied AI in enterprise, infrastructure, model training companies
- **Mining Services** - AI-powered exploration, automation, predictive maintenance

## Notes for AI Coding Assistants

This project uses:
- Svelte for frontend (not React)
- Tailwind for styling (utility-first CSS)
- Express for backend API
- PostgreSQL + Qdrant for data
- Monorepo structure (shared types between frontend/backend)
- Single container deployment
- PWA requirements (service worker, manifest.json)
- Nordic aesthetic (blues, teals, gold, minimalist)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark mode default

The intelligence pipeline (Kafka, scrapers, agents) is separate and not part of the public site deployment.
