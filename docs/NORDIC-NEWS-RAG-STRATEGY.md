# Nordic Unicorn News - RAG System Tracer Bullet Strategy

**Created:** 2025-10-20
**Purpose:** Use Nordic news as low-stakes validation of entire dev-rag system
**Status:** Strategy design

---

## 🎯 Core Strategy

**Nordic Unicorn News = Tracer Bullet for dev-rag**

**Why This Is Smart:**
- ✅ **Low stakes domain:** If it's shit, throw it out and start over
- ✅ **Real-world validation:** Test architecture with actual data
- ✅ **Resource discovery:** Learn actual RAM/CPU/disk usage on Beast
- ✅ **Guardian Pi proof:** See if RSS monitoring → Kafka works in practice
- ✅ **Tech stack validation:** Confirm Qdrant + Kafka + Ollama choices
- ✅ **Agent testing:** Validate autonomous Editor + Writer agents
- ✅ **Non-vital:** Won't break anything critical if we fail

**What We Learn:**
1. Does our tech stack work in production?
2. How much resources do we actually use?
3. Does Guardian Pi monitoring work reliably?
4. Can agents generate quality content autonomously?
5. What breaks? What needs iteration?

**Then Apply To:**
- Security domain (CVE tracking, high stakes)
- Trading domain (market analysis, very high stakes)
- Development domain (Cardano docs, medium stakes)

## 🏗️ Revised Phase Plan

### Phase 1: Coming Soon Page ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** LIVE at https://nordicunicornnews.com
**Duration:** 1 hour (2025-10-20)
**Output:** Static nginx site with moose-unicorn branding

---

### Phase 2: RAG Infrastructure (Tracer Bullet Foundation)
**Goal:** Deploy and validate RAG system with Nordic news domain
**Duration:** 3-5 days
**Status:** Not started

#### What We're Building:
```
Guardian Pi (192.168.68.10)
    ↓ (monitors Nordic RSS feeds)
    ↓ (detects: IPO, Defence, AI, Mining keywords)
    ↓
Kafka on Beast
    ↓ (topic: nordic-news-events)
    ↓
ydun-scraper (existing)
    ↓ (extract article content)
    ↓
Ollama (mxbai embeddings)
    ↓ (1024-dim vectors)
    ↓
Qdrant (vector storage)
    ↓ (semantic search)
    ↓
Ready for Phase 3 (agents)
```

#### Steps:
1. **Deploy Qdrant on Beast**
   - Docker container
   - Create "nordic-news" collection
   - Binary quantization enabled
   - Validate: can store/retrieve vectors

2. **Deploy Kafka on Beast**
   - Docker container
   - Create "nordic-news-events" topic
   - Validate: can publish/consume messages

3. **Deploy Ollama with mxbai on Beast**
   - Docker container
   - Download mxbai-embed-large model
   - Validate: can generate embeddings

4. **Guardian Pi: RSS Monitoring**
   - Python script watches Breakit.se RSS
   - Detects keywords: "IPO", "First North", "Defence", "AI", "Mining"
   - Publishes to Kafka when found
   - Validate: events appear in Kafka

5. **Scraping Pipeline**
   - Kafka consumer triggers ydun-scraper
   - Article content extracted
   - Validate: can scrape Nordic articles

6. **Embedding Pipeline**
   - Scraped content → Ollama → embeddings
   - Embeddings stored in Qdrant
   - Validate: can retrieve similar articles

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Nordic article detected by Guardian
- [ ] Event published to Kafka
- [ ] Article scraped by ydun-scraper
- [ ] Embeddings generated by Ollama
- [ ] Stored in Qdrant
- [ ] Can query: "Show me articles about Nordic defence IPOs"
- [ ] Results returned with semantic search

**Validation Questions:**
- How much RAM does Qdrant use? (expected: ~8GB)
- How much RAM does Kafka use? (expected: ~4GB)
- How much RAM does Ollama use? (expected: ~12GB)
- Total: ~24GB (Beast has 96GB available)
- Does Guardian Pi reliably detect articles?
- What's the latency from RSS → Qdrant?

### Phase 3: Autonomous AI Newsroom
**Goal:** Editor orchestrator + Writer agent that generates articles
**Duration:** 5-7 days
**Status:** Not started
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete

#### What We're Building:

```
Kafka: nordic-news-events
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Editor Agent (Sonnet 4.5 Orchestrator) │
│  - Reads Kafka events                    │
│  - Queries RAG: "Similar articles?"      │
│  - Decides: New article or update?       │
│  - Assigns to Writer Agent               │
│  - Reviews output                        │
│  - Publishes to PostgreSQL               │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Writer Agent (Haiku 4.5)               │
│  - Receives assignment from Editor       │
│  - Queries RAG for company context       │
│  - Queries RAG for similar IPOs          │
│  - Generates original English article    │
│  - Returns to Editor for review          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Agent Architecture (Claude Agent SDK):

**Editor Agent Container:**
- Built with Claude Agent SDK
- Autonomous event loop
- Connects to:
  - Kafka (consume events)
  - Qdrant (query RAG)
  - PostgreSQL (store articles)
  - Writer Agent (via API)

**Writer Agent Container:**
- Built with Claude Agent SDK
- Stateless (processes one assignment at a time)
- Queries RAG for context
- Generates article
- Returns to Editor

#### Steps:

1. **Build Editor Agent Container**
   - Claude Agent SDK setup
   - Kafka consumer loop
   - RAG query logic
   - Decision logic: new article vs update?
   - PostgreSQL writer
   - Validate: can consume events, make decisions

2. **Build Writer Agent Container**
   - Claude Agent SDK setup
   - RAG query function
   - Article generation prompt
   - Validate: can generate quality articles

3. **Connect Pipeline**
   - Guardian detects article
   - Kafka event published
   - Editor consumes event
   - Editor queries RAG: "Do we have articles about this company?"
   - **Decision logic:**
     - If important news + no existing article → assign to Writer
     - If minor update → just update company metadata
     - If duplicate → ignore
   - Writer generates article
   - Editor publishes to database

4. **Deploy Both Containers**
   - docker-compose.yml additions
   - Environment variables (API keys)
   - Validate: end-to-end autonomous operation

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Guardian detects Nordic IPO announcement
- [ ] Editor receives event
- [ ] Editor queries RAG (finds no existing article)
- [ ] Editor assigns to Writer
- [ ] Writer generates original English article
- [ ] Editor publishes to database
- [ ] Article appears in database
- [ ] **FULLY AUTONOMOUS - NO HUMAN IN LOOP**

**Learning Questions:**
- What % of generated articles are quality?
- How many API calls per article? (cost estimation)
- Latency: RSS feed → published article (target: <5 min)
- Do we need specialist writers or is 1 generalist enough?
- What breaks? What needs iteration?

---

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
**Goal:** Display AI-generated articles on nordicunicornnews.com
**Duration:** 2-3 days
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 complete

#### What We're Building:
- Svelte frontend queries PostgreSQL
- Shows AI-generated articles
- "Updated X minutes ago" indicators
- Company profiles with latest news
- Newsletter signup (store to PostgreSQL)

**Simple scope:**
- No user accounts yet
- No watchlists yet
- Just: Browse companies, read articles, sign up for newsletter

---

## 🎯 Start Simple - Complexity Later

**Phase 2 Start:**
- ✅ 1 Guardian Pi script (Breakit.se RSS only)
- ✅ 1 Kafka topic
- ✅ 1 Qdrant collection
- ✅ Basic scraping pipeline

**Not Yet:**
- ❌ Multiple RSS sources (add later if Breakit works)
- ❌ Multiple Kafka topics (add when needed)
- ❌ Complex Guardian logic (start dumb, get smart)

**Phase 3 Start:**
- ✅ 1 Editor agent
- ✅ 1 Writer agent (generalist)

**Not Yet:**
- ❌ Specialist writers (Defence/AI/Mining) - add if generalist fails
- ❌ Complex decision trees - start with simple rules
- ❌ Human review - full autonomous from day 1

## 🔄 Jimmy's Workflow Integration

**Every step follows RED → GREEN → CHECKPOINT:**

### Phase 2 Example:
**🔴 RED:** Deploy Qdrant container
**🟢 GREEN:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:6333/collections
docker logs qdrant-container
# Validate: Collection exists, accepts vectors
```
**🔵 CHECKPOINT:** Commit docker-compose.yml, document rollback

### Phase 3 Example:
**🔴 RED:** Deploy Editor agent
**🟢 GREEN:**
```bash
# Trigger test event to Kafka
# Watch Editor logs: "Event received, querying RAG..."
# Verify: Article created in database
```
**🔵 CHECKPOINT:** Commit agent code, document autonomous operation

---

## 💰 Cost Estimation (Phase 3 - AI Newsroom)

**Assumptions:**
- 10 Nordic IPOs per month
- 5 articles per IPO (initial + 4 updates)
- = 50 articles/month

**Per Article:**
- Editor queries RAG: 2K tokens input (Sonnet 4.5) = $0.006
- Writer generates article: 5K tokens input + 2K output (Haiku 4.5) = $0.0066
- Total per article: ~$0.013

**Monthly Cost:**
- 50 articles × $0.013 = **$0.65/month**

**With 100 articles/month:** **$1.30/month**

**Conclusion:** Basically FREE to run autonomous newsroom! 🎉

---

## 🧪 Validation & Learning Framework

**After Phase 2:**
- Resource usage spreadsheet (RAM/CPU/disk)
- Guardian Pi reliability log
- Latency measurements (RSS → Qdrant)
- Decision: Iterate or throw away infrastructure

**After Phase 3:**
- Article quality rubric (1-5 scale)
- API cost tracking (actual vs estimated)
- Autonomy success rate (% of articles that need editing)
- Decision: Iterate or throw away agents

**After Phase 4:**
- User engagement (if any users visit)
- Newsletter signups
- Decision: Keep building or pivot

- [ ] Guardian Pi monitoring live
- [ ] Can query: "Nordic defence IPOs" and get results
- [ ] Resource usage documented

**Phase 3 Success:**
- [ ] Fully autonomous article generation
- [ ] Quality articles (subjective, but readable)
- [ ] <5 min latency (RSS → published)
- [ ] Cost under $2/month

**Phase 4 Success:**
- [ ] nordicunicornnews.com shows AI articles

## 🔄 Iterate or Throw Away?

**Good signs:**
- RAG queries return relevant results
- Agents generate coherent articles
- Guardian Pi is reliable
- Resource usage is sustainable
- Cost is low

**Bad signs (throw away):**
- RAG queries return garbage
- Agents hallucinate wildly
- Guardian Pi is flaky
- Resource usage exceeds Beast capacity
- Cost spirals

**Learning either way:** If we throw it away, we learned:
- What doesn't work
- Why our assumptions were wrong
- How to design better next time
- All with low stakes (just Nordic news)
